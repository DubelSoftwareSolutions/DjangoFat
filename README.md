Software Design for the first robot I have ever built (in cooperation with Szymon Jasak). It has been developed as a conclusion to robotic workshop organised by KoNaR students' association.

The code was created in C with help of STM toolchain including STM CubeMX and STM Workbench for STM32F103RCT6 microcontroller.
